Define a good name for your methods or procedures
------------

* A good name should be the one who describe the role of the method or procedure.

* For those methods that doesn't return any value ("procedure"), let's name it with a verb. For example:  "calculateTax" or  "makePizza".

* For those who return value, its recommend it to use a word that describe the object or value it  return by the method. For example: "isActive" or "getCustomer".

* Never use generic names for name a method or procedure. For example: "manage" or "customerProcess".

* Is recommended to use style convention, lets use CamelCase or PascalCase, the one you prefer.
